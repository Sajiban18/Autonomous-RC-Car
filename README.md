# Autonomous-RC-Car

Built an Autonomous RC Car using a simple RC Car, Arduino Uno Board and some electronic components. In summary this car collects data from HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensors. The HC-SR04 sensor is connected to either a stepper or servo motor. This acts like a radar scanning for obstacles dynamicly from left to right. As this RC Car is a rear wheel drive it only uses two motors; a motor to handle the rear wheels and another for the steering. The car moves in forward direction and whenerver it comes across an obstacle (object or wall) the program makes a decision on the direction to move based on the readings from the HC-SR04 sensor.
